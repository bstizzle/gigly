# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


Done:
1. Creator show page, new page, edit page
2. Artist new page, edit page
3. Project new page, edit page, show page
4. ArtistSpecialty new page 
5. validations/error feedback for artist, creator, artist_specialty, and project_artist

Still to do: 
1. Add a "completed" or "seeking_artist" column to projects via migration 
2. sessions controller
3. Authentication & Authorization
4. Styling (CSS)

Problems: 
1. Carrying over @creator instances to create new projects and carrying over @project instances to create new project specialties.
