This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


Done:
1. Creator show page, new page, edit page
2. Artist new page, edit page
3. Project new page, edit page, show page, index page
4. ArtistSpecialty new page 
5. validations/error feedback for artist, creator, artist_specialty, and project_artist
6. logout button/path
7. Only shows you edit profile, logout buttons, and create new project buttons if user is on their own show page 
8. If NOT logged in, shows no buttons, but you can still view the pages
9. Authentication & Authorization
10.  Currently you have to add a password in order to edit your creator. Fixed! 
11. Automatically add creator id to new project form 
12. Automatically add project name to new project form 


Still to do: 
1. Add a "completed" or "seeking_artist" column to projects via migration 
4. Styling (CSS)
5. Search Button  for Artists Index and Projects Index 
6. Add a validation to project deadline that makes it have to be x number of days in the future
7. Add a Nav bar to the top of every screen 
8. Add a "contact" button to a show page if you are not the current user but are signed in 
9. Building out project artists -- How a project can have artists 


Problems: 

Artist Side Deliverables: 
1. Allow an artist to accept or reject a job
2. Add a picture column for artist in the migrations
