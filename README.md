# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


Done:
1. Creator show page, new page, edit page
2. Artist new page, edit page
3. Project new page, edit page, show page
4. ArtistSpecialty new page 
5. validations/error feedback for artist, creator, artist_specialty, and project_artist
6. logout button/path
7. Only shows you edit profile, logout buttons, and create new project buttons if user is on their own show page 
8. If NOT logged in, shows no buttons, but you can still view the pages

Still to do: 
1. Add a "completed" or "seeking_artist" column to projects via migration 
2. sessions controller
3. Authentication & Authorization
4. Styling (CSS)

Problems: 
1. Currently you have to add a password in order to edit your creator. Fix this
